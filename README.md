# Phastgg Website

This is the official website for **Phastgg**, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the development server locally, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once running, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the site.
Start editing by modifying app/page.tsx. Changes are hot-reloaded automatically.
This project uses next/font to load Geist, Inter and Poppins.
